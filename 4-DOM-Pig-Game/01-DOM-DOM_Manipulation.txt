THE DOM and DOM Manipulation:
-----------------------------

DOM (Document Object Model):
Structured representation of an HTML document.
The DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like JavaScript.
For each HTML box, there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

For picture representation, please look into Udemy course video: Section 4: THE DOM AND DOM MANIPULATION
