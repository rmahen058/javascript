/*
Datatypes in Javascript
Primitive Datatypes-
Very basic data types which are not objects
    Number:
    Floating point numbers, for decimals and integers.
    String:
    Sequence of characters, used for text.
    Boolean:
    Logical data type that can only be true or false.
    Undefined:
    Data type of a variable which does not have a value yet
    Null:
    Also means 'non-existent'
    
Javascript has Dynamic Typing- Which means we dont have to callout the datatype which declaring the variable
